Google Analytics is great, but since I own this domain and the server behind this website what fun is it to not build a home grown simple website usage software. The goals for this project are:
1. Track usage metric on any page on this website
2. Keep the data-pipeline that processes metrics generic
3. Stay within the AWS ecosystem (the time I authored this I worked at Amazon)

To start with there are few things to know about how this site is deployed.
