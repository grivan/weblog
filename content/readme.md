Hello, by trade I am a software engineer. I have written production code in Java, Python and Objective-C. My first priority when writing any code is to make sure it is readable and testable. Code extensibility is also important to me.

I also enjoy designing software systems. Thinking hard about scale and requirements. I feel organizing software and developer teams such that many people can contribute to it at once is key to success in any organization. I've taken leadership positions in the past and I specially like to think and read about people aspect of software development.

Please take a look at my
