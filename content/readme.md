Hello, I am software engineer and an overall "doer". I've worked in many different languages (C, Python, Obj-C, Java) and many different domains. Some highlights include shipping a an iOS application with 500k+ installs, bootstrapping metadata systems for Hulu, and most recently working on Forecasting systems at Amazon.

I enjoy designing software systems. I feel organizing software and developer teams such that many people can contribute to it at once is key to success in any organization. I've taken leadership positions in the past and I specially like to think and read about people aspect of software development.
