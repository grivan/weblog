Hello, I am software engineer and an overall "doer". I have worked in many different languages (C, Python, Obj-C, Java) and many different domains. Some highlights include shipping an iOS application with 500k+ installs, bootstrapping backend metadata systems for Hulu, and most recently working on large scale distributed services at Amazon.

I feel organizing software systems and developer teams in such a way that many people can meaningfully contribute to it at once is key to success in any software organization. I've taken leadership positions in the past and I specially like to think and read about people aspect of software development.

Please take a look at my
