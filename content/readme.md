I am a software engineer with 9+ years of professional development experience. I have deep expertise in the software design of large-scale data systems. In my professional experience, Iâ€™ve acted in the capacity of an individual contributor, technical lead, and development manager. My sweet spot is senior-level individual contributor roles where I can drive long-term strategic software projects requiring deep technical expertise and management skills like planning, communication, delegation, and mentorship.
